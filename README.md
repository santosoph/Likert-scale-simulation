# Likert-scale-simulation
In this R code, we simulate how five different Likert scale changes (3 to 11-point) could impact on the corresponding IRT properties of scale variations.
We start to generate our categorical data in **data generation** and then perform one of polytomous IRT model in **GRM modeling** and finally interpret the results in **extract GRM results**. 

Code adaptation for further research is kindly appreciated. Good luck !
